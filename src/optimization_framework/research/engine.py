"""Researcher-guided, budgeted algorithm design.

This module proposes research actions; it never starts numerical jobs. Its graph
state is JSON serializable and emitted after each role so the service can retain
an audit trail and resume an interrupted discussion without replaying paid calls.
No provider configuration means an explicitly curated, deterministic assistant,
not a simulated LLM. Source URLs are provenance, not proof of verification.
